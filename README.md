# Forced Convection Steady-State Laminar Flow Through a Pipe
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine the local and average Nusselt numbers for hydrodynamically fully developed, thermally developing, steady-state flow in a pipe. The dimensionless solution of the thermal energy equation subject to constant wall temperature is discretized using an implicit finite-difference scheme.
