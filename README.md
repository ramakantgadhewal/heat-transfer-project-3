# Forced Convection Steady-State Laminar Flow Through a Pipe
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine the local and average Nusselt Numbers for hydrodynamically full-developed, thermally developping, steady-state flow in a pipe.. The dimensionless solution of the thermal energy equation subject to constant wall temperature is discretized using an implicit finite difference scheme.
